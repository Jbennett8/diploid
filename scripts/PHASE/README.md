| **PHASE**                  | Takes specially formatted sequence alignments and phases them using the PHASE algorithm, created by Matthew Stephens                                                                                                                      |
| **bpp_to_fasta.py**        | Converts phylip files output from MCcoal into the fasta format required for seqphase1.pl                                                                                                                                                  |   
| **fasta_to_phylip.py**     | Converts fasta files output from seqphase2.pl into bpp-readable phylip files                                                                                                                                                              |
| **phasing.sh**             | Modified and submitted to the SGE cluster by use_PHASE.sh, this bash script runs the scripts in order required to process a sequence file generated by MCcoal through the program PHASE and then back into a bpp-readable phylip file |
| **seqphase1.pl**           | Converts fasta format sequence alignments into input files readable by PHASE, created by Jean-Francois Flot                                                                                                                               |
| **seqphase2.pl**           | Converts files ouput from PHASE into fasta format sequence alignments, created by Jean-Francois Flot                                                                                                                                      |
| **use_PHASE.sh**           | For each leaf node in the PHASED directory, modifies phasing.sh to phase that specific sequence file, and submits the phasing.sh job to the cluster                                                                                   |
